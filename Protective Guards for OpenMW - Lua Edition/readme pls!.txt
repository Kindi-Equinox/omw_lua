Openmw Lua is still early in development, therefore some functions are not available yet.

Note:
Guards will only protect the player if crime level is 0.
Any NPCs with the name matching "guard" or "ordinator" will protect the player.
Any NPCs wearing imperial cuirass will be considered as guards. (temporary workaround)
Don't let your followers wear imperial cuirass, or they will bug out. 


Feel free to modify the mod to suit your needs.
